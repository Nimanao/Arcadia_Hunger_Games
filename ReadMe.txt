#ARCADIA HUNGER GAME SIMULATOR

This is a text based game, where the player provides a group of characters, with their name, pronouns, and "power group" provided.

The concept is based off the Hunger Games Simulator provided here: https://brantsteele.net/hungergames/disclaimer.php

The world of the game is based off a Discord Roleplay group called Arcadia Unleashed, that has since been disbanded. The main important thing to note is that there were 5 "power groups"; ignis (fire), vita (life), terra (earth), aqua (water), and ventus (light/shadows). 

The characters can be stored in "arcadia_hunger_games\HungerGames\headshots\STORAGE" where they will not be included in the reaping. 

Characters placed in "arcadia_hunger_games\HungerGames\headshots" will be included in the games, and can be placed into folders within this folder in order to determine "districts" (groups for the characters). If characters are not assigned a district, the program will give them one.

Images of each round are stored in the "game_rounds" folder, for ease of sharing.

Issues:
	This program is unfinished, and therefore has certain elements that need work.
	
	Reaping list: needs a list of the districts at the beginning
	
	Stats: needs to show how many characters each character has killed, and who is left alive at the end of each round
	
	Multi-character events: if more than 2 characters are involved in an event, it currently only shows the first two character images.
